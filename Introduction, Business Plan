Introduction/Business Plan (Draft)

The homogeneity of the neighborhoods in a city represents an important variable to consider for new businesses, either as an indicator
for the potential of a new business to penetrate a stagnating market or a signal that a particular type of business is particularly 
competitive in a given region. While the exact implications of a more or less homogenous market require careful analysis and study to 
gain more reliable insights, initial determinations of neighborhood business composition and the existence/nature of clusters of 
'similar' neighborhoods provide valuable initial looks into  markets. 

This project will therefore study Atlanta, an established but continuously developing metropolitan area, and examine the clusters of 
neighborhoods present in the city to determine overall homogeneity (higher percentages of neighborhoods in a smaller amount of clusters
would indicate a highly homogenous city, vice versa for the opposite), and offer comparisons between Atlanta and two other cities: 
New York and Toronto. If the data allows, further analysis will be performed to determine most common venue categories within each cluster
to offer suggestions as to categories that are highly successful/competitive.
